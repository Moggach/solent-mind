## What are we building? ðŸ§±

- Our application offers a platform for the students of [_**Solent Recovery College**_](https://www.solentmind.org.uk/) to sign-up/log-in, view and book courses related to mental health.
- Each user can have a quick overview of the available courses, the ones they have joined and their progress, as well as make a new booking.
- Our goal is to build an easily accessible platform for our target group, to enhance their experience, as well as facilitate the organisers in scheduling and managing the participants.
